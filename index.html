    <h1>(In the opening scene after George and Harold hum the fanfare of DreamWorks, a fade black is seen on screen)

        HAROLD: (from o.s) DreamWorks Animation presents... (George puts a yellow paper in front of the screen that says "In Assosiastiun With")
        
        GEORGE: (from o.s) In association with... (Harold puts a logo that says "Treehouse Comix, Inc.")
        
        GEORGE AND HAROLD: Treehouse Comix, Inc.! (George hums and turns the page which it says "A long, long, long, long time ago")
        
        GEORGE: All right, okay. So, a long, long, long, long time ago... (The other rectangle page then says "In a galaxy far, far away") In a galaxy far, far, away... (He turns the page where the earth is in space) There's a planet called Underpanty World.
        
        HAROLD: Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. (He erases half of the earth and draws the blank bottom of the earth into an underwear) Okay, go. (Zoom in to people flying around wearing red capes and underwears)
        
        GEORGE: Underpanty World was a peaceful planet where everybody wore only underwear. (The whole city starts crashing and the people fly away) Until, it started to blow up for some reason. (Pan to Big Daddy Long Johns panicking)
        
        BIG DADDY LONG JOHNS: Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh. (He is then holding a space baby)
        
        SPACE BABY: Da-da.
        
        GEORGE: Meanwhile, the leaders of Underpanty World, Big Daddy Long Johns and his wife Princess Pantyhose saved their baby by stretching his underwear really far and then they shot him into space. (Big Daddy Long Johns sees the spaceship flying away and runs to Princess Pantyhose and throws the space baby to her and puts him in the sling shot. Princess Pantyhose lets go of the space baby)
        
        BIG DADDY LONG JOHNS: Godspeed, little Underpants.
        
        SPACE BABY: Whee! (The underwear earth explodes. The space baby flew by some astronauts and crashes on the ground)
        
        GEORGE: And then he crashed on earth and he was raised by some nice fi...(Two dolphins pop up) Dolphins? (The dolphins start chirping)
        
        HAROLD: Yeah, dolphins. Just go with it.
        
        GEORGE: Okay, fine.
        
        SPACE BABY: (from o.s) Goo goo, ga ga! Tra-la-la-la-la-la! (The male dolphin picks up the space baby. The female dolphin coos)
        
        GEORGE: But, the space baby grew up fast. (The space baby grows up and turns into Captain Underpants)
        
        FEMALE DOLPHIN: Eugh! (Pan to the school bus)
        
        BOY #1: Look! Up in the sky! It's a bird!
        
        GIRL: It's a plane!
        
        BOY #2: It's an egg salad sandwich! (Pan to the egg salad sandwich wearing underpants)
        
        EGG SALAD SANDWICH: And guess what? (Knocks down the bridge) I'm rotten! (He laughs maniacally. The people in the bus start screaming as they fall down. Pan to Captain Underpants flying)
        
        CAPTAIN UNDERPANTS: Faster than a speeding waistband! More powerful than boxer shorts! (He uses his underpants to hold the broken bridge as the people in the bus go across)
        
        EGG SALAD SANDWICH: You'll never catch me, Captain Underpants! (He laughs maniacally and flies in the sky scraper which causes a wedgie to his underwear) Owie!
        
        CAPTAIN UNDERPANTS: Able to leap tall buildings without getting a wedgie! (Flies down to the policeman)
        
        POLICEMAN: Hey, alright, good for you, pal. Now put on some clothes, you weirdo.
        
        CAPTAIN UNDERPANTS: (Laughs) No way! I fight for truth, justice, and all that is preshrunk and cottony! For I am... (He uses his power to use electricity and flies away)
        
        HAROLD: Captain Underpants! (He writes the words on the title. Zoom back to Harold Hutchins and George Beard) The origin issue.
        
        GEORGE: It's so good. We should've done an origin issue ages ago.
        
        HAROLD: Yeah, like, first.
        
        GEORGE: You know, I'm not sure about the dolphins, though.
        
        HAROLD: Yeah, I know, it's just, I didn't know if it was the thing where it's like, good weird or bad weird. Like is it something... (All of a sudden, Mr. Benjamin "Benny" Krupp grabs the comic book and rips it apart.)
        
        HAROLD: (sobbing) The origin issue!
        
        KRUPP: I've told you two a thousand times not to draw these idiotic comics! (He tears up the comic book and letd the pieces fly everywhere. George uses his arms to make a cross)
        
        GEORGE: Freeze! (The scene suddenly freezes, except George and Harold. He waves to the audience) Hey, everybody! Wait one second. (Removes the pieces) Hi, I'm George Beard, and this is my best friend, Harold Hutchins.
        
        HAROLD: (Takes one of the pieces of the comic book) Hey. Aw, man.
        
        GEORGE: Its okay. We got more ideas. (To the audience) See, Harold loves to draw and I love to tell stories. And this old guy looking angry right here, well, this is the worst principal in the world, Mr, Krupp.
        
        HAROLD: Mean old Mr. Krupp. Hates anything fun. Like comic books, (The camera pans to the torn-up comic pieces still floating in the air) recess... (The scene changes to the drawings of three kids playing jump rope until Krupp cuts the rope with scissors) Christmas... (The scene changes to the drawing in a winter setting Santa riding in his sleigh before flooring it back the way he came after Krupp jumpscares him) Even kittens! (The drawing of Krupp uses a flame thrower on the kitten with a censor bar blocking the carnage)
        
        GEORGE: Oh, my goodness, did that really happen?
        
        HAROLD: Uh, no. Not technically. (angrily) BUT IT MIGHT AS WELL HAVE! I'm sorry, I-- I'm so mad about the comic.
        
        GEORGE: Yeah, me too. (Sits back down and makes a cross again by his arms and covers his ears) And unfreeze. (The scene then unfreezes and the pieces of the comic book fall down and Krupp unfreezes as well.)
        
        KRUPP: (furious) In my office... (George covers his ears for this) NOW!
        
        (Cuts to Krupp's office...)
        
        GEORGE: (whispers to Harold) What is happening right now?
        
        HAROLD: I don't know.
        
        GEORGE: Do you think he fell asleep with his eyes open?
        
        HAROLD: Maybe. Let's try and leave and see what happens.
        
        (George and Harold slowly walking away toward the door, but Krupp pushed the button. The security door locked up.)
        
        HAROLD: Ahh!
        
        (Security door key twisted to locked up.)
        
        DOOR VOICE: Door lock activated.
        
        GEORGE: Wow! That's an expensive door.
        
        KRUPP: It was a choice between the magnetic automatic door closer... and the music and arts programs.
        
        (Flashback to art room. A boy is painting a picture while a girl plays the tuba.)
        
        KRUPP: Agh!
        
        (Krupp puts the painting board inside the tuba and evilly chuckles. End flashback.)
        
        KRUPP: Pretty sure I made the right choice. This morning's school sign is supposed to read... "Sewage plant field trips are today". So can either of you explain why it now reads... (pulls up the blinds revealing the school sign) "Come see my hairy armpits"?!?
        
        (George and Harold laughing)
        
        KRUPP: I know you two are responsible.
        
        GEORGE: How? How do you know? Do you have any proof? I mean, this is a country of laws.
        
        KRUPP: The proof is here. Inside my gut.
        
        HAROLD: He must have a lot of proof in there. Quiet fives.
        
        GEORGE: Quiet fives.
        
        KRUPP: Ever since you attended this elementary school... you've been responsible for one prank after another.
        
        (Mr. Fyde pulls down the slider, picture of him working out with muscles)
        
        KIDS: (laughing)
        
        MS. RIBBLE: Shh... (The chair boings up to Ms. Ribble and the kids laughing)
        
        (Mr. Meaner uses a basketball attached to gum and it stretches back, hitting him)
        
        KIDS: (laughing)
        
        (Mr. Krupp opens a bag and green slime splatters all over him and Mrs. Ribble and gets up but realizes she’s stuck on her chair and Mr. Fyde pulls down the slider, with a picture of him as a strongman, Edith opens the door and Krupp is using the toilet, scaring the lady. A bucket of pink slime drops on a teacher's head. Meaner and Ribble get squirted with water from the fountain while Krupp gets a big flood. The librarian screams at books hanging from the ceiling. A real-life tiger scares Mr. Fyde. Krupp is bombarded with water balloons. Edith opens a closet to let out a lot of bubbles. George and Harold are floating in them before popping out to land back in their seats.)
        
        GEORGE: Wow, That's a lot of pranks.
        
        HAROLD: Yeah, when it's cut all together like that, you really get a sense of our scope.
        
        GEORGE: Some of those must've been really hard to pull off.
        
        HAROLD: And dangerous. Like that tiger?
        
        GEORGE: Oh, that tiger was crazy!
        
        KRUPP: Augh! (bangs his head on the desk) For four long years... you two have been disrupting the carefully calibrated, drone-like beehive... that this elementary school is supposed to be. I may not be able to prove it yet... but I'm gonna get you two one day. One day very, very soon. (flashes an evil smile)
        
        GEORGE: All right.
        
        HAROLD: Fair enough.
        
        KRUPP: Get out of my office. (slams his fist on the desk) Now!
        
        [The two boys leave the office.]
        
        GEORGE: You see what we're up against? And that's just a typical day at Jerome Horwitz Elementary.
        
        HAROLD: More like Jerome Horwitz Penitentiary.
        
        [We see a few students looking gloomy.]
        
        TOMMY: Hey, guys.
        
        GEORGE: What's going on, Tommy?
        
        TOMMY: Same old, same old. (gets inside his locker)
        
        GEORGE: (sighs) Poor kid.
        
        MS. RIBBLE: Time to have fun with history. (gets out a piece of paper) Memorize these dates. 1827, 1853, 1914, 1926.
        
        HAROLD: First graders. Always hits them the hardest.
        
        GEORGE: Hold on a sec.
        
        [He puts a paper with a finger in a nose on the mural of Mr. Krupp, making it look like he’s picking his nose. The duo giggle at this.]
        
        GEORGE: So that's why we do what we do. He's left us no choice.
        
        [They enter their classroom and take their seats.]
        
        GEORGE: Our pranks and practical jokes are the last line of defense... against the injustice of our terrible principal.
        
        MELVIN: Well, well, well. I heard you both got into a bit of the old trouble today.
        
        GEORGE: How'd you hear that, Melvin?
        
        HAROLD: Did you tattle-tale on us?
        
        MELVIN: Maybe I did, maybe I didn't. I did. Someone has to stand up for the Man.
        
        GEORGE: No one has to stand up for the Man. That's the whole point of the Man. He stands up for himself, Melvin.
        
        MELVIN: Respectfully disagree.
        
        KRUPP: (on speaker) Attention, everyone. Principal Krupp here with an announcement. This Saturday is the mandatory Invention Convention.
        
        GIRL: Boo!
        
        GEORGE: Oh, what?
        
        MELVIN: Yes!
        
        MR. FRYE: That's our third Saturday this month!
        
        KRUPP: (on speaker) You must be here with your inventions at 8:00 am.
        
        HAROLD: Is there no justice?
        
        KRUPP: (on speaker) I know that's early for Saturday, but don't worry. You should be done by 9:00... pm.
        
        [The students grimaced while Melvin jumped for joy. Later, the bell rings and everyone leaves the school.]
        
        GEORGE: Tree house?
        
        HAROLD: Tree house.
        
        [George and Harold head to their treehouse hangout.]
        
        GEORGE: Welcome to the world headquarters of Tree House Comix, Inc.
        
        HAROLD: Yep. This is where the magic happens. Not, like, actual magic. No, we're not practicing the dark arts. No, here we just hang out and make comics and try to make each other laugh.
        
        GEORGE: That's how we became friends.
        
        [The flashback shows the boys' younger selves.]
        
        YOUNG GEORGE: This is me in kindygarten.
        
        YOUNG HAROLD: And this is me. George and I aren't friends yet. But we're about to be.
        
        Mrs. Dayken: The seventh planet from the sun is called... Uranus. Scientists refer to Uranus...
        
        Young Harold: Your anus. (laughs)
        
        Mrs. Dayken: ...as one of the planets...
        
        Young George: I know. (laughs)
        
        [They become quiet when the teacher looks at them. Then, her back is turned.]
        
        Mrs. Dayken: ...known as a gas giant.
        
        [The two boys laughed again.]
        
        Young Melvin: I don't get it. It's just science, guys.
        
        Mrs. Dayken: As I was saying...
        
        Young George: Hey, I'm George. You wanna hang out in my tree house after school?
        
        Young Harold: You have a tree house?
        
        [The flashback ends]
        
        GEORGE: Ever since then, we've created hundreds of comics in here. Like the Wrath of the Wicked Wedgie Woman.
        
        HAROLD: And who could forget Sad Worm? It was a worm who was sad. That one's still a work in progress.
        
        GEORGE: But the all-time greatest superhero that we've ever created was... The Amazing Captain Underpants.
        
        HAROLD: See, most superheroes look like they're flying around in their underwear.
        
        GEORGE: Well, this guy actually does.
        
        HAROLD: Come on, let's get to work.
        
        [And so, the two boys started to work on their comics]
        
        GEORGE: Hey, tell me what you think.
        
        HAROLD: Oh, I can't wait to draw this.
        
        GEORGE: Tra-la-laaa!
        
        HAROLD: Wait, wait. Don't move, don't move.
        
        [Hours past and the book was compelted.]
        
        GEORGE: Mr. Hutchins, I gotta say... your drawings get better with every issue.
        
        HAROLD: Because your words inspire greatness, Mr. Beard.
        
        GEORGE: Good night, Harold.
        
        HAROLD: Good night, George.
        
        GEORGE: (sings) I love Saturday!
        
        HAROLD: (sings) When anything is possible!
        
        GEORGE: (sings) I love Saturday 'cause I can wear my pajamas all all day!
        
        HAROLD: (sings) I love Saturday 'cause I can watch TV all..
        
        GEORGE AND HAROLD: (singing) Day!
        
        HAROLD: (sings) I can pee a little bit in my underwear, and no one will mind.
        
        GEORGE: Where are you going with that? Do you really do that?
        
        HAROLD: No. What are you talking... It's just something I could do because...
        
        [They go outside.]
        
        GEORGE: (sings) Monday's an eternity away!
        
        HAROLD: (sings) When it is...
        
        GEORGE AND HAROLD: (singing) Saturday!
        
        GEORGE'S MOM: Get in the car, boys. You got the Invention Convention today.
        
        (The scene then switches back outside, and the cat begins hissing and jumps in the air to catch a bird with the dog beginning to have a scuffle over the bird. It then begins to storm, then with the scene cutting to a tree branch where a leaf curls up, then snaps off. The camera then pans down to the line of kids slowly marching into the school's Invention Convention.)
        
        KRUPP: Is this thing on? *Ahem.* Quick announcement. Our science teacher, Mr. Fyde, is no longer with us.
        
        (The kids gasp, except George and Harold)
        
        GIRL: He's dead?! (begins crying)
        
        KRUPP: What? No! Not like that. He wanted to spend Saturday with his family, (he laughs for a brief moment) so I fired him! I'll find a replacement next week. *Ahem* On to Melvin Sneedly with the first of his 16--
        
        MELVIN: [peeks from the curtains] Actually it's 17.
        
        KRUPP: 17 inventions. Take it away, Melvin.
        
        MELVIN: I will now demonstrate a prototype which I call... the Robotic Sock Matcher. Never waste time matching your own socks again. The Electromagnetic Lint Collector. Digital Paper Sorter. It's the homework... actimatic cushion.
        
        HAROLD: Make it end!
        
        MELVIN: And the personal favorite, the binder binder. Having trouble organizing your binders? Well, look no further than this giant binder... for binders. Three-hole punch...
        
        [he slammed the giant binder down, making George and Harold to wake up.]
        
        GEORGE: This is the stuff of nightmares. We have to do something about this.
        
        HAROLD: I don't know. Krupp looks serious this time, George. Maybe we should just lay low for a while.
        
        GEORGE: Lay low? Look at our fellow children. Look upon their sad, miserable, pathetic faces. Come on, Harold. If you won't do it for me and you won't do it for you... do it for future generations. Save the first graders... the kindygarteners, the unborn... from a life of eternal boredom!
        
        [Soon, Krupp falls asleep.]
        
        HAROLD: Okay, let's do this.
        
        [They sneak backstage while Melvin shows his latest invention.]
        
        MELVIN: Feast your eyes on this. The Turbo Toilet 2000!
        
        [Once they got close, they started tampering unaware that a turtle robot is staring at them]
        
        MELVIN: Check it out, people. It's already programmed with my personal potty playlist.
        
        HAROLD: Screwdriver.
        
        MELVIN: Oh, samba! Once you're done using the facilities... hit the button and let my toilet wash itself. Now included, actimatic toilet paper wiping claw. Trademark.
        
        [However, George and Harold press the button, causing the Toilet bot to go haywire. It started shoot toilet paper.]
        
        MELVIN: I said no!
        
        [Krupp wakes up when a toilet paper bumped him.]
        
        KRUPP: Huh? Oh... Melvin, turn that thing off.
        
        MELVIN: I'm trying to, but it's not cooperating.
        
        [All of the kids started to celebrate as Melvin tried to control the toilet bot. Finally it stopped and exploded into confetti, sending Melvin flying into the crowd.]
        
        GEORGE: Best.
        
        HAROLD: Prank.
        
        BOTH: Ever.
        
        [The two boys leave the school with fake credits rolling behind them.]
        
        GEORGE: Well, that brings our story to its happy conclusion.
        
        HAROLD: I hope you've all enjoyed the film.
        
        GEORGE: It was certainly shorter than we expected.
        
        HAROLD: What more is there to say? Our fellow students got to enjoy their weekend. Which, by the way, they are legally entitled to.
        
        GEORGE: And good triumphed over evil once and for...
        
        KRUPP: Oh, boys! A moment, please.
        
        [George and Harold look at each other, realizing they are in trouble. In the office, Krupp has an evil grin on his face.]
        
        GEORGE: What's happening to his face?
        
        HAROLD: I think he's smiling. I'm so cold. So, so cold.
        
        [Melvin enters the office.]
        
        MELVIN: I'll let myself in, receptionist lady.
        
        KRUPP: Melvin.
        
        GEORGE: What's he doing here?
        
        KRUPP: You see, Melvin is yet to demonstrate... his most impressive invention from today. It was a little extracurricular project I asked him to come up with myself.
        
        MELVIN: I call him the Tattle Turtle 200. On the outside, it resembles a turtle. But on the inside, oh, look at this. It's a nanny cam!
        
        KRUPP: Oh, Melvin. How fun. Let's see what it recorded.
        
        [He plugs the cord in the TV and turns on the screen, but it shows nothing.]
        
        MELVIN: Yeah, you gotta change the input to video.
        
        KRUPP: I think I got this.
        
        MELVIN: You're on AUX. Change it to video.
        
        KRUPP: It's not my TV. It's your turtle.
        
        MELVIN: You're doing it wrong.
        
        KRUPP: I know. I think I know how to do my office.
        
        [The TV then shows footage of the boys setting up the prank.]
        
        HAROLD: (on TV) Screwdriver.
        
        GEORGE: (on TV) Is this two-ply or one-ply?
        
        HAROLD: (on TV) We're so guilty.
        
        GEORGE AND HAROLD: (on TV) Quiet fives. Quiet fives.
        
        HAROLD: Wow, that nanny cam really has good picture quality.
        
        GEORGE: Was that hi-def? 'Cause you could really tell that's us.
        
        KRUPP: I can't believe it. (laughs evilly as he walks to his desk) I gotcha. I finally gotcha!
        
        MELVIN: We've finally got them, sir.
        
        KRUPP: Yes, yes. Well done, Melvin. Extra credit granted.
        
        MELVIN: Put that in my pocket. (chuckles) Extra credit, it feels so good! (leaves the room) I got extra credit
        
        KRUPP: I told you I would get you one day. And that day I was talking about is this day. Today. This is the day.
        
        HAROLD: Are you going to tell our parents?
        
        KRUPP: No. Your parents are obviously total failures. I have a much more effective punishment in mind. Because I'm going to have you two placed in separate... classes. I'm going to annihilate your friendship.
        
        GEORGE: What? No!
        
        KRUPP: You see? You won't be together. You won't be able to enjoy each other's company and ruin my life.
        
        HAROLD: Mr. Krupp, no. You can't do this. Please.
        
        GEORGE: This is too much. I mean, even for you.
        
        KRUPP: Enjoy the rest of your weekend, boys. Because come Monday... (cackles evilly)
        
        [A thunderstorm transitions to the treehouse. Inside, Harold and George are saddened that they will be seperated.]
        
        HAROLD: Separate classes. Our friendship's over. I'll never see you again in my life!
        
        GEORGE: Hey, hey. Calm down. It's not the end of the world. We'll still be best friends. Just way down the hall from each other. What am I talking about? This is bad. Long distance relationships never work!
        
        HAROLD: This is just the beginning. Imagine the future.
        
        [He holds two socks with different colors up and the scene changed to a sock puppet version of how their friendship will end.]
        
        HAROLD: Friends separated... promising each other they'll remain besties. But within months, we'll be awkwardly bumping into each other at the mall.
        
        [At a homemade version of a mall, we see sock versions of George and Harold as adults in different escalators.]
        
        PUPPET HAROLD: Hey, George.
        
        PUPPET GEORGE: Hey. Do I know you?
        
        HAROLD: You'll have a weird haircut. I'll be wearing a suit for some reason. And before we know it, separate classes will lead to separate lives... which inevitably leads to robots.
        
        [Suddenly, robots attack the mall.]
        
        PUPPET GEORGE: What? Why are there robots at the mall?
        
        PUPPET HAROLD: Because this is the future! The future always has robots.
        
        [The robots then shoot at each other.]
        
        PUPPET GEORGE: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Why are the robots shooting other robots? Aren't they supposed to be friends?
        
        PUPPET HAROLD: I don't know! I'm the artist, you're the writer. That's why we need each other.
        
        [The giant Tattle Turtle bursts in and fires lasers from its right eye, setting fire to the mall.]
        
        PUPPET GEORGE: Help! Fire!
        
        [Fade back to the treehouse.]
        
        GEORGE: Okay, you're right. No, you are right. I mean, if we get put in separate classes, it's the end of the world as we know it.
        
        HAROLD: What are we gonna do?
        
        GEORGE: Oh, I'll tell you what we're gonna do. First thing Monday morning, we're getting that turtle.
        
        [In the school, Harold and George hide int eh closet to see Krupp in his office.]
        
        KRUPP: Edith!
        
        EDITH: Oh, is this a bad time? I did not mean to interrupt the copying process. I'll go.
        
        GEORGE: Yes, go! Please go.
        
        KRUPP: No, no. I'm just finishing up. What brings you around here?
        
        EDITH: I just made this tuna casserole... and I noticed it had your name on it... in jalapeno peppers.
        
        KRUPP: It smells spicy.
        
        EDITH: Yep. Mmm-hmm. That's 'cause it's been dry-aged for a week.
        
        KRUPP: I don't know what that means, but it sounds very time-consuming.
        
        EDITH: It took a week.
        
        [In the closet...]
        
        GEORGE: Eww. They like each other.
        
        HAROLD: Oh, no, George. I think it's much worse. They like-like each other.
        
        GEORGE What are you talking about? Adults don't like-like other adults.
        
        HAROLD: Well, you probably haven't seen it at your home since your parents are married. In my studies, like-liking seems to end with marriage.
        
        [Back with Krupp..]
        
        KRUPP: Well, I should probably get back to running the school. You know, it's not gonna run itself.
        
        EDITH: But... Oh, Edith. Get your head out of the clouds.
        
        KRUPP: Wait, Edith! You never gave me the tuna casserole.
        
        HAROLD: I think he forgot the turtle.
        
        GEORGE: Go, go, go.
        
        [They head over to the office onlt for Ms. Anthelope to enter.]
        
        HAROLD: Great. What now?
        
        GEORGE: Hello. If you would like the chance to win one billion dollars... Ooh. please hold for one of our representatives.
        
        [George and harold sneak into the office.]
        
        GEORGE: It's gotta be in here somewhere.
        
        [George looks and opened up a cabinent filled with toys.]
        
        HAROLD: What?
        
        GEORGE: Everything Krupp ever confiscated from us.
        
        HAROLD: Look at all that stuff.
        
        GEORGE Oh, dear old whoopee cushion. You will sing once again.
        
        HAROLD: Oh, my Super Duper Soaking Machine!
        
        [George then takes out a plastic ring]
        
        GEORGE: My hypno-ring! I never even got to take it out of the wrapper.
        
        HAROLD: Wow. Look at this. He's got every issue of Captain Underpants we've ever created. You think he reads them?
        
        GEORGE: I was kinda hoping that we appealed to a slightly cooler demographic.
        
        [Suddenly, Mr. Krupp enters and slams the door behind him.]
        
        KRUPP: Well, if it isn't George Beard and Harold Hutchins. To what do I owe the pleasure? Is it perhaps this?
        
        HAROLD: Oh, no.
        
        KRUPP: Nice try. Turtle and I have grown quite attached. We're inseparable, actually. I carry him wherever I go. Including the shower!
        
        [The Tattle Turtle sheds a tear.]
        
        HAROLD: Poor turtle.
        
        KRUPP: Oh, what's this? Why, it's the paperwork to separate you two. It's really incredible. I can actually see the end of your friendship. And it ends right here. On this dotted line.
        
        HAROLD: George, do something.
        
        GEORGE: [points his ring at Krupp] Put the pen down, Mr. Krupp... or we'll hypnotize you!
        
        KRUPP: What?
        
        HAROLD: What?
        
        GEORGE: You said do something.
        
        KRUPP: What is that?
        
        GEORGE: Forged from the molten plastic of Shandong, China. In the lowest floor of the darkest basement where only toy prizes dare be made... exists the most powerful item... ever to be found in a box of Frosted Sugar Doodles. The hypno-ring.
        
        KRUPP: Hypnotize me? With that piece of plastic junk?
        
        HAROLD: Does that really work?
        
        GEORGE: What do you think? I got it out of a cereal box. I'm warning you. If you don't do what we say, you're gonna get really sleepy.
        
        KRUPP: Oh, will I? I'll get sleepy? With that thing pointing at me? It's not making me sleepy. I'm not gonna get sleepy from...
        
        [He yawns, until something strange started to happen.]
        
        KRUPP: What kind of plastic hokum is this?
        
        HAROLD: What's happening?
        
        GEORGE: I don't know! Why are we floating?
        
        HAROLD: What was that?
        
        GEORGE: I don't know. I honestly didn't think that would happen.
        
        HAROLD: Gotcha. You're safe now, little turtle.
        
        GEORGE: When I snap my fingers, you will obey our every command.
        
        HAROLD: Wait. How do you know this?
        
        GEORGE: I don't know. I just say the first thing that comes to my mind with great authority. You are now a chicken.
        
        HAROLD: It worked! He's a chicken. Okay, let me try. Let me try. You're a monkey.
        
        HAROLD: Oh! Look at him, he's a monkey!
        
        GEORGE: Come on.
        
        GEORGE AND HAROLD: You are now the greatest superhero of all time... the amazing Captain Underpants!
        
        UNDERPANTS: Tra-la-laaaaa!
        
        HAROLD: Captain Underpants? Is that really you?
        
        UNDERPANTS: Let's see. Underpants, check. Captain, also check. I'm pretty sure I'm Captain Underpants.
        
        GEORGE: It worked!
        
        UNDERPANTS: Which must make you my trusty sidekicks!
        
        BOTH: Sidekicks?
        
        UNDERPANTS: Fear not, this planet is safe under my watchful eye.
        
        GEORGE: This is hilarious!
        
        HAROLD: This is amazing!
        
        UNDERPANTS: Let's see what's afoot. [crash]
        
        GEORGE: Wait, no!
        
        UNDERPANTS: Well, that was invigorating.
        
        HAROLD: We gotta stop him.
        
        GEORGE: Why?
        
        [Just then, Captain Underpants gets hit by a car and doesn't notice.]
        
        UNDERPANTS: Huzzah!
        
        DRIVER: Out of the road, bozo!
        
        UNDERPANTS: Why, thank you, vehicle person! [runs off to another person's yard, leaps, then crashes] Ow!
        
        GEORGE: Yeah, we should probably go get him.
        
        [They get out of the window, slide down the flag pole, and started to chase after Captain Underpants.]
        
        GEORGE: Captain Underpants, wait!
        
        UNDERPANTS: What is this? Poor soul. You're trapped in some sort of invisible box-like prison. What's that? I can't hear you. But I see your tears.
        
        HAROLD: Is it okay that I'm kinda loving this?
        
        GEORGE: Yes and no. But mostly yes.
        
        UNDERPANTS: Fear not, for I will set you free!
        
        MIME: Ow! What is wrong with you?
        
        UNDERPANTS: Oh, that's better. I can hear you now.
        
        HAROLD: Sorry, sorry. We're so sorry.
        
        GEORGE: Okay, listen, let's not be punching people, though, because...
        
        UNDERPANTS: Hold it. Here, let me help. You're welcome, madam.
        
        HAROLD: You know, we should probably get you back to the school before anything else...
        
        UNDERPANTS: Halt!
        
        GEORGE: What?
        
        UNDERPANTS: Do you sense that?
        
        GEORGE: No.
        
        UNDERPANTS: Well, of course you don't. You're not a superhero like me. Come, sidekicks. Evil lurks within!
        
        HAROLD: Oh, no!
        
        GEORGE: Where'd he go now?
        
        UNDERPANTS: To the sky!
        
        [Underpants makes whoosing noises while he is on the elevator.]
        
        HAROLD: You'd think a guy like him would be easy to find.
        
        GEORGE: Found him.
        
        UNDERPANTS: Stand down, you giant ape monster!
        
        HAROLD: Giant ape monster? What is he talking...
        
        UNDERPANTS: Your days of terrifying this town are over!
        
        HAROLD: Mr. Krupp! I mean, Captain Underpants! You can't actually fly!
        
        UNDERPANTS: Now I take to the sky... like an ostrich! [jumps onto the balloon gorilla] I gotcha!
        
        GEORGE: We gotta do something. I've got an idea.
        
        GEORGE: Morning.
        
        CONSTRUCTION WORKER: Morning.
        
        HAROLD: Oh, that is a lot of buttons.
        
        UNDERPANTS: Take that! Ah, cheap shot! Ow! Right in the kisser!
        
        GEORGE AND HAROLD: No!
        
        UNDERPANTS: Oh, hi, guys!
        
        GEORGE: Wait! No! Follow that gorilla!
        
        UNDERPANTS: Oh, you put up a good fight!
        
        GEORGE: Yeah! You are so good at operating a crane, Harold.
        
        HAROLD: I know! It's really not that hard.
        
        UNDERPANTS: Rest assured, citizens of this marvelous metropolis... I will rid you of this menace any moment now!
        
        HAROLD: Come on. Oh, come on, come on, come on.
        
        UNDERPANTS: Victory!
        
        GEORGE: Yes!
        
        HAROLD: Bravo!
        
        [The crane starts to go out of control.]
        
        HAROLD: Oh, no, no, no!
        
        UNDERPANTS: Let that be a lesson to evildoers everywhere. Never underestimate the power of underwear!
        
        OFFICER: Who the heck are you? What the...
        
        HAROLD: Wow! I can't believe we found a spot.
        
        GEORGE: Oh, goodness. Grandpa, you did it again.
        
        HAROLD: He's a sleepwalker. Come on, pap pap, let's get you back into bed.
        
        UNDERPANTS: But what about all the other evil villains?
        
        GEORGE: Well, don't worry about that. There's no more evil villains around here.
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: A science teacher, hmm? The perfect cover.
        
        [Soon, the three arrive at the treehouse.]
        
        UNDERPANTS: Chums! What an astounding headquarters. Stuffed full of relics... all celebrating my interplanetary exploits! Oh, this takes me back.
        
        HAROLD: What are we gonna do? He can't just stay here. We have to turn him back into Krupp.
        
        GEORGE: I know, but can we just take a moment to acknowledge what's happening here please? I mean, Captain Underpants is hanging out in our tree house!
        
        (George and Harold laugh at the scene.)
        
        UNDERPANTS: Well, a hero's work is never done. Now it is time to fly again!
        
        GEORGE: No, no, no, no!
        
        KRUPP: Where am I? Where are my pants?
        
        HAROLD: Oh, no! He's Krupp again.
        
        UNDERPANTS: Tra-la-laaa!
        
        GEORGE: That's it! Now we know what turns him back and forth.
        
        UNDERPANTS: Turns who what?
        
        KRUPP: Why am I soaking wet?
        
        HAROLD: Cool.
        
        UNDERPANTS/KRUPP: Hey. Tra-la-laaa! Harold! Tra-la... George! ..laaa!
        
        GEORGE: We should probably stop.
        
        HAROLD: Yeah, we probably should.
        
        UNDERPANTS/KRUPP: Stop doing this! Tra-la... I am Captain... What are you doing? Hello? Well, hello! What's happening? Fear not! Didn't know I could do this. Hey, sidekicks! Tra! Hey! Heyo! Tra-la-laaa!
        
        GEORGE: Okay, this is the street. Come on, come on. We're almost there.
        
        BOTH: Evening.
        
        MAN: Evening.
        
        GEORGE: Drop it. No, get off. Gimme! That's a bad dog.
        
        HAROLD: We made it. Yeesh. I wonder what horrors lie inside.
        
        GEORGE:There's probably wild dogs in there.
        
        HAROLD: Probably torture implements.
        
        GEORGE: Rabid rats.
        
        HAROLD: Brains in jars.
        
        GEORGE: Jars of plucked-out eyeballs.
        
        HAROLD: Bones of former students.
        
        GEORGE: Why'd you scream?
        
        HAROLD: I just assumed there'd be something scary... but it's actually a really nice place.
        
        GEORGE: We probably shouldn't snoop around.
        
        HAROLD: Yeah. Definitely not.
        
        GEORGE: Come on.
        
        [They begin to look around. They look in the kitchen but the fridge hat only one ketchup bottle, a single fork, and a single cereal box.]
        
        GEORGE: Not So Cheery O's?
        
        HAROLD: This guy's bumming me out.
        
        [They look in the bathroom.]
        
        GEORGE: I gotta say, this has not been the funnest snoop.
        
        HAROLD: Yeah, no, totally. Really sad snoop. Kinda regretting it, actually.
        
        [Later, the toy boys pulled Krupp into his bed.]
        
        HAROLD: I sure hope we don't ever end up like him. All alone.
        
        GEORGE: It's impossible. That would never happen.
        
        HAROLD: Yeah, yeah. That'll never happen. Unless he puts us in separate classes.
        
        GEORGE: Which will never happen. It'll never happen. 'Cause we control him now. And if ever gives us any trouble again, all we gotta do is snap our fingers... and "Tra-la-laa!" All of our problems go away.
        
        GEORGE: Hey, Tommy. What's going on?
        
        TOMMY: Hey, guys. Whoa! Cool shirts!
        
        KRUPP: What are you two doing together? I separated you.
        
        GEORGE: No, you didn't.
        
        KRUPP: What are you talking about? I signed the paperwork. See?
        
        GEORGE: I don't see a signature. Harold, do you see a signature?
        
        HAROLD: Not a thing. I actually can't see a thing. These sunglasses are too dark.
        
        KRUPP: What? I could have sworn I signed that thing. No matter. There! Officially separated. Forever. [laughs, then notices George taking the signature] What? Give me that!
        
        UNDERPANTS: Tra-la-laaa!
        
        GEORGE: See? Problem solved.
        
        UNDERPANTS: Greetings, citizens!
        
        GEORGE: Quick, in here.
        
        HAROLD: Okay, you know what? These shirts were way premature.
        
        GEORGE: Definitely. Come on. Let's turn him back into Krupp.
        
        HAROLD: We can't. He'll separate us, remember?
        
        GEORGE: Yeah, well, we can't have him wandering around looking like that.
        
        UNDERPANTS: A triangle! It dings!
        
        [Underpants plays the triangle ramdomly. George and Harold look at the clothes and then gets an idea.]
        
        HAROLD: [pretending] Ah! Principal Krupp, you caught us again. You better take us to your office for a good old talking-to. Right? Principal Krupp?
        
        UNDERPANTS: Principal who?
        
        GEORGE: Captain Underpants, get out here.
        
        UNDERPANTS: Sidekicks... are you sure my secret identity requires these... restricting, uncomfortable clothes?
        
        GEORGE: Yes, positive.
        
        HAROLD: 100% positive. Now act like a principal.
        
        UNDERPANTS: Oh, right. How does a principal act?
        
        BOTH: Mean!
        
        UNDERPANTS: Okey-doke. [pretending to be a zombie] I'm a principal!
        
        HAROLD: Oh, yeeh. That's great.
        
        GEORGE: Come on. We're almost there.
        
        EDITH: Oh, hello. Surprise. It's Edith. Did you like my tuna casserole?
        
        UNDERPANTS: I cannot lie. I don't recall having your tuna casserole.
        
        EDITH: What? Oh.
        
        UNDERPANTS: But if your casserole is as striking as your one blue eye...
        
        EDITH: Oh, I didn't think you noticed. [moves away her hair from her face to reveal two blue eyes]
        
        UNDERPANTS: Oh, my. Two blue eyes.
        
        GEORGE: Principal Krupp. It's time to go. Gotta wrap it up.
        
        UNDERPANTS: Very well then. Up, up, and...
        
        HAROLD: And this way, sir.
        
        EDITH: Ooh! Flirt alert.
        
        GEORGE: Wow, she's still on hold.
        
        HAROLD: Phew! We made it.
        
        UNDERPANTS: Well, hello, citizen.
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Oh, and hello to you, too. I was just, like, admiring the view... from your broken window. It's in the shape of a man. Anyway, I am here to interview for the science teacher position.
        
        UNDERPANTS: Perfect. I'm disguised as an elementary school principal. Guys, I totally got this. Don't worry one bit.
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Now, where did I put that resume? No, not that. Oh, this thing. This one's fun. Heads up. That one's gonna leave a mark. I've been looking for that. Oh, not that. Ah-ha! Here we go.
        
        UNDERPANTS: Hmm. Says here you're a science teacher?
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Not exactly.
        
        UNDERPANTS: But you have teaching experience?
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Oh, no, I can't say that I do.
        
        UNDERPANTS: Not even, like, babysitting?
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS:: I would never sit on a baby.
        
        UNDERPANTS: Camp counselor?
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Never was a camp counselor. Although I did receive counseling... for some trauma I experienced as a child.
        
        UNDERPANTS: I'm getting a really good vibe about you.
        
        GEORGE: Now hold on. Let me see that resume. It says here that you were a genius inventor?
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Mad... genius inventor. But yes.
        
        HAROLD: And then for the last few years... you've "been in a very dark place"... and your title was... "Revenge Seeker?" "Revenge at all costs... "Die! Die!" Am I reading this right?
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Yeah, that's basically what I've been up to... so here I am! Applying for a job in the thriving public school system... with all of it's amazing resources. But honestly, kids are so understanding. So innocent. Their smiles brighten my heart and fill me with... a joy-adjacent feeling. As long as they are controlled... and do not laugh nor smile nor play nor laugh. Children must never laugh!
        
        UNDERPANTS: Well, you seem terrific! You're hired!
        
        BOTH: What?
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Excellent. Oh, by the way, going to need Fridays off... and every other Tuesday through Thursday... for my evil experiments. Hope that's not a problem. Okay, bye-bye!
        
        GEORGE: Oh, this is bad. We just hired a maniac for a science teacher!
        
        HAROLD: Uh, yeah. We gotta fix this before Krupp finds out.
        
        UNDERPANTS: Sounds like a job for Captain Underpants.
        
        GEORGE: No, no, no. You need to stay here. Okay, you're the principal, remember?
        
        HAROLD: Yeah, just sit there and look angry for no reason.
        
        UNDERPANTS: You got it. Grr...
        
        [Harold and George leave.]
        
        UNDERPANTS: That will be interesting to put my eye up to.
        
        [He accidently squirts the water gun, turning himself back into Krupp.]
        
        KRUPP: What? How did I get here? Why is my face wet?
        
        [Harold and George head totheir classroom where Poopypants writes down his name.]
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Hiya, class. I'm your cool, new teacher. Not some scary guy with a secret evil agenda. Anyway, I'm just going to dive right in here. If there was one thing about this world that you could change... what would it be?
        
        GIRL: Ooh! Ooh! Peace on Earth.
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Unattainable. Anyone else?
        
        GEORGE: Pacific Ocean into chocolate.
        
        HAROLD: Atlantic into nacho cheese.
        
        GEORGE: It's like we're the same person and yet so, so different. I love it.
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: But more importantly... if I had to change one thing about the world... it would be to get rid of... laughter.
        
        GEORGE: Get rid of laughter?
        
        HAROLD: What kind of person wants to do that?
        
        MELVIN: Oh, oh! Ah! Ah! Sir, sir.
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Yes?
        
        MELVIN: I love it.
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Oh, look at this. We got a grade A suck-up. Good to know, good to know. Anyway. This is the brain of an average child. Right here is the "thinking about candy" lopalus. The "fear of what's under the bed" lobe. This is the "only thing I'll eat is pizza... "chicken nuggets, or buttered noodles" lobe. Right here is the "as soon as someone else has a toy... "I want that toy" anterior lobe. And this... This is the Hahaguffawchuckleamalus. This funny little purple part holds our entire capacity for laughter. For years, I've tried to shrink it or cut it out entirely... but frustratingly, our survival seems dependent upon it.
        
        GEORGE: I don't like this. I mean, I don't really understand it. But the stuff I am understanding seems genuinely bad to me.
        
        HAROLD: Yeah, same. Um... Excuse me, Professor P? Why are you trying to get rid of laughter? Isn't laughter the best medicine?
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Medicine is the best medicine! So...
        
        HAROLD: Yeesh.
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: What?
        
        GEORGE: What does the P stand for?
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Excuse me?
        
        GEORGE: The P. In your name. What does it stand for?
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Oh, it's private.
        
        GEORGE: So that means your name is Professor Privates?
        
        MELVIN: What's so funny? I don't get it.
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Principal's office, now! You too!
        
        GEORGE: Why him?
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Because your friendship and shared sense of humor irritates me... and must be destroyed!
        
        GEORGE: We gotta do something about that new science teacher.
        
        HAROLD: Yeah, it's like he's even more of a villain than Krupp.
        
        GEORGE: I didn't even think that was possible.
        
        KRUPP: Whoa! Whoa! Wait a second.
        
        HAROLD: Tell me about it.
        
        KRUPP: What? Who do you think...
        
        HAROLD: Oh, okay. Maybe we could fix this if we just...
        
        KRUPP: Can you hear me?
        
        HAROLD: No, that'll never work.
        
        KRUPP: I'm sitting right here.
        
        GEORGE: Wait, Professor P doesn't want anybody to know his last name. Right?
        
        HAROLD: Right!
        
        KRUPP: Who's Professor P?
        
        HAROLD: Exactly!
        
        KRUPP: Where is the respect? I am your principal!
        
        GEORGE: Wait, is he Krupp again?
        
        KRUPP: George!
        
        HAROLD: Yup. Pretty sure he is.
        
        KRUPP: Harold!
        
        HAROLD: How'd that even happen?
        
        UNDERPANTS: Tra-la-laaa! Greetings! I need to get the... Sidekicks, what do I need again?
        
        BOTH: The file on the new science teacher.
        
        UNDERPANTS: Oh, right, right. I need the bile on the gooey fence creature.
        
        BOTH: Science teacher.
        
        UNDERPANTS: The dewy tense preacher? The dial on the...
        
        HAROLD: Oh, come on!
        
        UNDERPANTS: Thank you, human woman! Sidekicks, explain to me the importance of this secret file.
        
        GEORGE: There's a new super villain in town and we're trying to discover his weakness.
        
        [They look over the file and gasped when they saw his name]
        
        "Poopypants."
        
        Hallelujah
        
        Hallelujah
        
        His name is Poopypants
        
        We found his weakness
        
        Hallelujah
        
        He wants to rid the world
        
        Of laughter
        
        Forever
        
        And ever
        
        We will defeat him
        
        Hallelujah
        
        Hallelujah
        
        UNDERPANTS: (sings) Poopypaaaaaaants!
        
        HAROLD: Captain? You forgetting something?
        
        UNDERPANTS: Oh, look at that. They came off again.
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Hey there, kiddo. First day for Professor P. Can you tell me where the lunch is consumed? What's going on with your face? Are you choking? Do you need to sneeze? I see, I see. Got a case of the giggles, huh? That's fun. Well, I've got just the remedy for that. In the cage. Now!
        
        GIRL: Why?
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Because I hate laughter and children... and I've got a cage in a briefcase! Okay, well, have a nice day. Now what's for lunch?
        
        [Upon entering the cafeteria, the kids took notice of Prof. Poopypants and started to laugh. All except for Melvin.]
        
        MELVIN: Excuse me, could you explain to me why this is funny?
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: You! Why is everyone laughing?
        
        MELVIN: Uh, you're asking the wrong dude.
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: "Captain Underpants and the Perilous Plot of... "Professor Poopypants?" [kids laughing] Oh, What's happening? I'm hyperventilating.
        
        YOUNG PROF. POOPYPANTS: Esteemed members of the Nobel Prize Committee... it is with great pride... that I present to you... the Sizerator 2000! Behold, we can smallify. No more traffic jams. And conversely, largify. Look at how big this hot dog is. Going to need a lot of mustard for this frankfurter!
        
        The Nobel Peace Prize in Inventing Stuff goes to... um, Professor... Is that really your name? It's not, like, some kind of joke?
        
        YOUNG PROF. POOPYPANTS:No. It's not, like, a joke. It's a traditional name in New Swissland.
        
        Am I pronouncing it right? Poopypants?
        
        YOUNG PROF. POOPYPANTS: More or less. Except the emphasis is on the "poop." Why are you laughing? I've invented a shrinking and enlarging ray! I should be famous! I should be dating models twice my size... and doing the talk show circuit! I should be protecting baby seals as a cause... that I say I care about, but not really!
        
        This guy is too much!
        
        YOUNG PROF. POOPYPANTS: Stop! Stop laughing! No, stop it!
        
        Okay. Phew! Oh... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Here. Take the award. It's really fun to say Poopypants.
        
        YOUNG PROF. POOPYPANTS: You keep your stupid award! I don't want it anymore. Oh, and one more thing...
        
        On behalf of the Nobel Prize committee, please accept our apology. And could you change me back now please?
        
        YOUNG PROF. POOPYPANTS: Why don't you go on and invent your own shrinking and enlarging ray... if you think you're so smart?
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS:: How much of that was out loud?
        
        GEORGE: Extra! Extra! Get our latest issue!
        
        HAROLD: Captain Underpants and the Perilous Plot of Professor Poopypants. Oh, no.
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: There you are. I've been looking all over for you.
        
        UNDERPANTS: Hmm. How many A's are there in "Tra-la-laaa?"
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: What?
        
        UNDERPANTS: I'll just go with 11. Enjoying your first day, professor?
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: The complete opposite, actually. Look at what these little monsters have created! We must lock them up, probably, like, forever!
        
        UNDERPANTS: Hmm. Oh, my. This is not a comic. This is a history book.
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: What?
        
        UNDERPANTS: And as such, it should be taught in every classroom. And you yourself must teach it... because that is how good it is.
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: I don't understand. I thought, like, we'd be on the same page here.
        
        UNDERPANTS: What page is that? I'm on page 9, here. It's fantastic. Look, look. It's about this evil science teacher... who looks a lot like you, by the way. And he wanted to rid the world of laughter... but he couldn't figure out how to do it. Even worse, it seemed like everywhere he went, people were having fun and laughing. It just was infuriating. But then, he discovered someone who wasn't.
        
        COMIC MELVIN: I don't get it. Why is it funny?
        
        UNDERPANTS: Anti-Humor Boy! And then the professor says, "Very interesting." That's my voice for him.
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Wait, wait, wait. Gimme that. That's no Anti-Humor Boy. That's the suck up from class. Very interesting. You boys don't even realize it... but your silly comic book just helped me figure out... how to wipe out laughter on the... Oof!
        
        DRIVER: Out of the road, bozo!
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Hey, watch where you're going! You just hit Professor Poopypants.
        
        DRIVER: Poopypants? (laughs)
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: That's not funny! That's not funny!
        
        Ever heard of the sidewalk?
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Oh, if I had insurance, you'd be in... Ow! I'll admit that was surprising.
        
        HAROLD: Wow. That actually worked out for once. Good job, Captain Underpants.
        
        UNDERPANTS: At your service, sidekicks. Now where was I?
        
        GEORGE: We should probably get back to class, huh?
        
        HAROLD: Yeah, we probably should.
        
        Excuse me. Pardon me.
        
        If you could just...
        
        Watch your feet.
        
        Excuse me.
        
        Sorry. Thank you.
        
        Oh, hey, Todd.
        
        GEORGE: Now, let me ask you something. If you could control your principal... what would you do?
        
        HAROLD: Shh. It's starting. It's starting.
        
        MELVIN: I just wanna make sure you apply the extra credit to next semester. I won't be needing it this semester, of course.
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS:: Oh, yeah. Sure, yeah. Whatever floats your boat, Melvin.
        
        GIRL: Excuse me? Can I please get an ice cream sandwich?
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Yeah, scram, okay? We're closed for Ebola. Okay, just a quick check to make sure that we're connected.
        
        MELVIN: Mmm-hmm. Okay. We're sure that's safe?
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: And now, some classic funny bloopers! Ah. That's a good one. Oh, this one's my favorite.
        
        MELVIN: I'm sorry. Why are you showing me this?
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Come on, that was funny! That child walked right into that rake.
        
        MELVIN: I'm bored! What else is on?
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Fascinating. Computer, scan. I don't believe it. You know, I suspected something smaller than normal, but this... This.
        
        MELVIN: What? What is it?
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: I can't find it. [amazed] Your Hahaguffawchuckleamalus! You don't have one!
        
        MELVIN: I don't get it.
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Exactly. You have no sense of humor like a chair or a supermodel. Melvin, with your brain and my brain together... we can finally wipe out laughter for once and for all! So George and Harold want a supervillain... well, ask and ye shall receive!
        
        HAROLD: I hereby declare... the Jerome Horwitz art program... reinstated! After you, sir.
        
        GEORGE: Ooh, what if we...
        
        HAROLD: I'm already on it.
        
        GEORGE: Oh, this is gonna be epic!
        
        UNDERPANTS: Come on, Captain, draw! Move your hand in the shape of a person! Why does it look like a chicken? This whole visual storytelling thing is hard! Oh, that's good.
        
        HAROLD: Here, these need words.
        
        UNDERPANTS: Hey, sidekicks... why are we doing this again?
        
        HAROLD: Well, we're making school fun again. You know, "free the children."
        
        GEORGE: Hey, hey! What if we put this panel right here?
        
        HAROLD: Oh, yes! Yes, yes.
        
        UNDERPANTS: Ah, yes. Of course. Fun. On it!
        
        [A few hours of drawing comics, Harold and George notice that the kids are gone.]
        
        HAROLD: Where'd everybody go? Where did this even come from?
        
        GEORGE: Hey!
        
        UNDERPANTS: Oh, hey, sidekicks. Glad you could join.
        
        GEORGE: How did you even do this? I thought you said you were looking after the... Oh, my goodness! Is that a Ferris wheel?
        
        UNDERPANTS: Well, of course it is! It came with the carnival I ordered. This cotton candy makes me feel powerful!
        
        HAROLD: Hey, uh, where are all the teachers?
        
        UNDERPANTS: Detention. They have a real attitude problem.
        
        GEORGE: Sure beats having Krupp around!
        
        HAROLD: Oh, yeah. Krupp would totally lose his mind if he saw this.
        
        UNDERPANTS: Step right up! Who'll be the first to dunk the principal?
        
        BOTH: No!
        
        KRUPP: I'm drowning!
        
        GEORGE: All right, that's enough. Recess is over.
        
        UNDERPANTS: Ah, come on! Just one more ride!
        
        HAROLD: Hey, watch it!
        
        KRUPP: What is this, a carnival? I hate carnivals!
        
        UNDERPANTS: Oh, this looks fun! How do we play?
        
        GEORGE: Hold your fire!
        
        KRUPP: What is happening?
        
        UNDERPANTS: Who wants ice cream?
        
        KIDS: Ice cream!
        
        HAROLD: What are we gonna do? We can't keep this up forever.
        
        GEORGE: We have to! We'll just take shifts watching him. I'll take today. You take tonight.
        
        UNDERPANTS: Sugar!
        
        GEORGE: Harold, I really want some sugar.
        
        HAROLD: Me too.
        
        HAROLD: We made the wrong choice!
        
        GEORGE: This did not solve anything!
        
        UNDERPANTS: Hey, sidekicks! Check this out! Geronimo!
        
        BOTH: No!
        
        HAROLD: This way!
        
        UNDERPANTS: Field trip, anyone?
        
        GEORGE: No, no, no!
        
        UNDERPANTS: Nothing's more fun than fire! Except being on...
        
        KRUPP: Fire! What is happening?
        
        UNDERPANTS: Now, this is how you run a school! Free the children!
        
        [he leaps of on a parachute until a storm started to rain.]
        
        GEORGE: Wait a minute.
        
        [A droplet lands on Underpants's head, reverting him back to Mr. Krupp. He looks around to see the giant carnival mess.]
        
        KRUPP: What the... How did this... I don't understand.
        
        [The kid is still flying away.]
        
        KID: Help!
        
        KRUPP: What the...
        
        [He finds George and Harold in the midst of the mess and lands down, steamed than ever.]
        
        KRUPP: You...
        
        [George tried to snap his fingers to turn Krupp into Captain Underpants, but it was not working because of the rain.]
        
        KRUPP: You two. Your friendship... is no more.
        
        What?
        
        George!
        
        Harold!
        
        Harold! Come back!
        
        George, I'm right here!
        
        I'm right here!
        
        Oh, no! No, no!
        
        Don't leave me!
        
        I won't! I won't, George!
        
        Harold!
        
        No, no! Wait, wait! Stop!
        
        George!
        
        MELVIN: This thing is amazing, Professor P. You could probably solve world hunger with an invention like this.
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS:: Pass! More importantly... how do I look?
        
        MELVIN: Just like you do in this comic!
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Good! Now, hands off the merchandise, and go fetch your little toilet, okay?
        
        MELVIN: I call it "The Turbo..."
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Yeah, yeah. Couple of gold stars for you, kiddo. Let the Poopageddon begin! What? Oh, you've gotta be joking me! Poopypants has no gas! You can't write this stuff. Where would a burgeoning villain find unlimited power?
        
        MELVIN: True power comes from within.
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: No, it doesn't, Melvin! That's on stupid posters!
        
        MELVIN: Okay.
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: It comes from enormous energy sources! A nuclear waste dump.
        
        MELVIN: I see where you're going.
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS:: A poisonous chemical factory.
        
        MELVIN: Or perhaps a place even more toxic!
        
        EDITH: Whoo! These leftovers got a kick. Oh, it's a powerful smell.
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Back in business, baby!
        
        Memorize these elements...
        
        Oxygen. Beryllium.
        
        Boringillium.
        
        Lameium.
        
        Snoronium.
        
        Excuse me, everybody, there's a giant...
        
        Do not interrupt while I'm reading monotone from my textbook!
        
        But the toilet!
        
        Ugh. Just go.
        
        Harold?
        
        George?
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Students and faculty of Jerome Horwitz Elementary... the world, as you know it, is about to go extinct. And a new world order is about to rise! One that is, you know, honestly pretty similar to the old world order... except for one tiny detail...
        
        GEORGE: Melvin?
        
        MELVIN: Comin' atcha!
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Powered by Melvin's unique neurology... I will successfully disable the Hahaguffawchuckleamalus... of every single child at Jerome Horwitz Elementary. For I, Professor Poopypants... Yeah, it's a funny name. It just makes you laugh and laugh, right?
        
        GEORGE: Get down!
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Still give you the chuckles now? Poopypants!
        
        KIDS: I don't get it. Why is that funny?
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: : Perfect!
        
        MELVIN: Finally! You're speaking my language!
        
        Oh, no. This is bad.
        
        This is seriously bad.
        
        I mean, a world without laughter?
        
        George, if he destroys our sense of humor, he destroys us!
        
        Imagine how boring our comics will be. Captain Underpants and the Purchase of the Sensible Beige Pants.
        
        Captain Underpants Eats All of His Falafel.
        
        Captain Underpants Watches Cement Dry.
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: And would the creators of this absolutely hilarious comic book... please come out, come out, wherever you are! You're next.
        
        Okay, we have to stop him.
        
        We've gotta find a way to unplug Melvin.
        
        Yeah.
        
        But how do we get to him without Poopypants seeing us?
        
        KRUPP: What are you two doing together?
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Are you in there? Oh... Maybe you're hiding here. Oh, sorry. Are you stuck on hold?
        
        Mmm-hmm.
        
        Oh, totally hate when that happens.
        
        Well, good luck with that.
        
        Now, where are those two little...
        
        Stand down, Poopypants!
        
        What is happening?
        
        I hope this works.
        
        Tra-la-laaa!
        
        Ow! Ow!
        
        Keep standing down.
        
        I'm just gonna be a second.
        
        Ow.
        
        I bet he thought that was going to be cooler.
        
        Oh, boy. Here goes nothing.
        
        Ha-ha!
        
        Prepare to be vanquished... and justice to be served on a piping hot platter of freedom!
        
        With a side order of liberty... and a super-sized cup filled with freedom also! Impressive use of fast-food analogies, you giant baby with a cape on! Let's do this.
        
        GEORGE: Freeze! The following sequence contains scenes... that are so intense, horrific, and violent...
        
        HAROLD: And expensive.
        
        GEORGE: ..that we can only show it using a technology known as... Flip-O-Rama! Take it away, Harold.
        
        HAROLD: Okay, first Professor Poopypants gave Captain Underpants the boot.
        
        GEORGE: Foot! Foot! Ow!
        
        HAROLD: Then he made an Underpants sandwich.
        
        GEORGE: Punch, punch! Punch, punch!
        
        HAROLD: And then, they played a friendly game of paddleball! Oh, no! Darn. Okay, what's next? Oh, yes! Then, Poopypants summoned an army of dolphins...
        
        GEORGE: Wait, what? Why are you always sneaking dolphins into the movie?
        
        HAROLD: What do you have against dolphins anyway?
        
        GEORGE: I don't have nothing against dolphins, it just didn't happen!
        
        HAROLD Well, so what?! We get to say what happened! It's the Flip-O-Rama! I like dolphins. The dolphins are in.
        
        GEORGE: Fine, all right. Let's just keep going.
        
        HAROLD: You sure?
        
        GEORGE: Yep, positive.
        
        HAROLD: Thank you. Anyway, Poopypants didn't realize it...
        
        GEORGE: Quiet five, quiet five.
        
        HAROLD: ...but George and Harold's plan was working out perfectly. So, they shot themselves to the top of the Turbo Toilet 2000! To keep things dramatic, they didn't quite make it. And then... And then...
        
        GEORGE: What happened to the Flip-O-Rama?!
        
        HAROLD: I ran outta paper.
        
        Hey, Melvin!
        
        Take that thing off your head.
        
        We gotta stop Poopypants!
        
        MELVIN: Professor Poopypants! George and Harold are trying to stop you!
        
        You are just so annoying!
        
        [Soon, the villain appears with the robot holding Underpants.]
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: So, you two little numbskulls thought you could distract me... with this idiotic, naked man. Am I right?
        
        UNDERPANTS: I'm not naked!
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Any final words before this whole revenge thing goes down?
        
        GEORGE: Yeah, wait, wait. Listen. We apologize for making fun of your name. I mean, that was just wrong.
        
        HAROLD: Yeah, we're sorry. The truth is, Professor P... you have probably, like, the greatest name we've ever heard. I mean, George, imagine if we had names like that.
        
        GEORGE: Oh, that would be so cool! Okay, wait, let's do it. Let's try it. Oh, I would be Fluffy Toiletnose.
        
        HAROLD: Yeah! I would be Sir Cheeseball Wafflefanny.
        
        POOPYPANTS: Yeah, sure. You're a knight.
        
        GEORGE: This is so good! I wanna change mine. I'd be Buttcheeks von Stinkelsberg.
        
        UNDERPANTS: Stinkelsberg. (laughs)
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Yeah, those are all really silly names, but there's nothing funny about... Professor Pee-Pee Diarrheastein Poopypants Esquire!
        
        HAROLD: Sir, are you saying your full name is... Pee-Pee Diarrheastein Poopypants Esquire?
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: : Uh-huh.
        
        [The two boys start laughing.]
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Stop it! Stop laughing!
        
        GEORGE: Come on! Listen, your problem isn't that people laugh at you. Your problem is that you can't laugh at yourself.
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Oh, really, Oprah? Is that my problem? Well, your problem is this...
        
        [He drops captian underpants into the toilet's mouth.]
        
        BOTH: No!
        
        [then the mad scientist grabbed thw two boys.]
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Oh, I hope you enjoyed your years of laughter and merriment... because they're about to come to an end. Do you find anything funny about me now?
        
        GEORGE: You mean, other than your name? (he and Harold laugh)
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Yes! Other than that!
        
        HAROLD: And your hair?
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: What? My hair's cool, I thought.
        
        GEORGE: Are you kidding me? That's almost as funny as my hair back in kindygarten! Remember that afro? (the boys continue to laugh)
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: No! No, this can't be happening! Computer, activate brain scan. [the screen shows George and Harold's brains] Let's see. The frontal lobes look big and healthy. The Hahaguffawchuckleamalus looks all shrimpy, so, what gives?
        
        [He turns the brains to the side, where the hahaguffawchuckleamaluses are huge.]
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: AAH! It can't be! Their Hahaguffawchuckleamaluses, they're enormous! I need more power.
        
        [He turned the dial up high, and the beam blasted heavily at the boys.]
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Anything strike you as funny now?
        
        GEORGE: I'm sure we can think of something!
        
        HAROLD: George, I can't smile anymore.
        
        GEORGE: No! Harold!
        
        [George watched horrified as Harold loses consciousness.]
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: One down, und one to go.
        
        GEORGE: Harold....
        
        [George loses consciousness. Somewhere in their minds of the two boys...]
        
        GEORGE: Harold. Harold, can you hear me? Harold!
        
        HAROLD: George! George, is that you?
        
        GEORGE: Right here, buddy.
        
        [Their funny lobes start shrinking.]
        
        HAROLD: What's happening?
        
        GEORGE: We're shrinking! Now, if we don't laugh at something soon, we may never laugh again.
        
        HAROLD: [panicking] Oh, no! What do we do? What do we do? What do we do?
        
        GEORGE: Well, we have to think of something funny, okay?
        
        HAROLD: Okay, yeah, sure. Something funny.
        
        [They tried to think of something funny.]
        
        GEORGE: Anything?
        
        HAROLD: No, I got nothing.
        
        GEORGE: Me neither.
        
        [They shrink even more.]
        
        GEORGE: More shrinkage!
        
        HAROLD: Okay, okay. What did we use to find funny?
        
        GEORGE: Mostly potty humor. Poop, vomit, that kind of thing.
        
        HAROLD: Really? (shrinks down) Ugh. That is, like, the lowest form of comedy.
        
        GEORGE: Don't you say that, Harold! Don't you leave me!
        
        [Outside of George and Harold's heads...]
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Attention everyone! Poopypants here with a little update on the Poopageddon. Due to the success of my plan thus far... I've decided to wipe out laughter on the entire planet. After that, you know, I'll probably move on to other planets... Jupiter, Mars... can't forget Uranus!
        
        [Back in their heads...]
        
        GEORGE: Wait. Did he just say...
        
        Young Harold: Your anus. (laughs)
        
        YOUNG GEORGE: I know!
        
        [At that moment, their brains laugh which makes their Hahaguffawchuckleamaluses grow back to their original size.]
        
        Uranus!
        
        [Outside of their heads...]
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Yeah, and once I'm through with the gas giants... I figure I'll go after the other galaxies... What?
        
        GEORGE: It feels so good to laugh!
        
        [The immense power of their laughter starts to make the robot short circuit.]
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: No, stop it! Stop laughing! You're ruining everything!
        
        Yikes!
        
        MELVIN: Extra credit or survival? Extra credit or survival? I choose survival!
        
        Uh-oh!
        
        Oh, yeah!
        
        Wow!
        
        No, how could this be happening?
        
        GEORGE: Never underestimate the power of laughter, Poopypants!
        
        Oh, that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
        
        Oh!
        
        Ah! Whoa!
        
        GEORGE: Harold! Harold, we did it! Harold?
        
        HAROLD: I think I bruised a rib. Because I've never laughed so hard in my life!
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: : Oh, we'll see who's laughing once I shrink you down... where you will live in my pocket forever... amongst my cherry-flavored lip balm... my butterscotch-flavored lip balm...
        
        HAROLD: (picks up the shrunken car) Oh, neato!
        
        ...my mint-flavored lip balm... my extra-moisturized SPF lip balm... and all of my lip balms!
        
        Why does one person have so much lip balm?
        
        Help!
        
        Help!
        
        HAROLD: Please, anyone! Help!
        
        GEORGE: Help!
        
        [Meanwhile, inside the robot’s mouth, Underpants seems to be alive when he eats the radioactive leftovers causing him to gain powers. Outside...]
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Ooh, I hope you can find tiny enough pens... to make your small, little comic books with... 'cause you're about to get smallified!
        
        [The waistband warrior burst out of the green water, now with superpowers, abs, and muscles.]
        
        UNDERPANTS: Tra-la-laa! I feel... awesome!
        
        HAROLD: No way!
        
        GEORGE: He has real superpowers!
        
        HAROLD: Oh, that is an obvious twist that I did not see coming... despite my many years of comic book studies! (High-fives George)
        
        UNDERPANTS: I have come to save the day!
        
        STUDENTS: Yay!
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Yeah, and I've come to ruin it! So back off, buddy!
        
        STUDENTS: Aww.
        
        [Captain Underpants got in the sky and fired his underwear at the mad genius.]
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Ew, that's gross!
        
        UNDERPANTS: Oh, there's more where that came from. (Keeps firing his underwear) Monday! Tuesday! Wednesday! Thursday!
        
        HAROLD: Ha-ha! Unlimited underpants!
        
        GEORGE: I am so glad that we gave him that superpower!
        
        [He fired his underwear at his hand, which released his gun.]
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: My Sizerator!
        
        UNDERPANTS: (grabs the gun) Well, it's mine now!
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Alas! The final failure for Professor Poopypants.
        
        UNDERPANTS: (checks the gun) Hmm. What does this button do?
        
        [He then accidentally fires the gun at Poopypants to be giant.]
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Well, hello down there!
        
        BOTH: No!
        
        UNDERPANTS: Must be holding it backwards.
        
        [He fired the gun at himself, which made him small and lose the gun.]
        
        UNDERPANTS: Yup. That was it.
        
        GEORGE: Wow. He is super dumb.
        
        HAROLD: I can't reach.
        
        UNDERPANTS: Time to take you down once and for all, Poopypants!
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Buzz off!
        
        GEORGE: Captain Underpants! Fly over here so we can make you big again!
        
        UNDERPANTS: Crackerjack idea.
        
        HAROLD: George, just don't...
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Ha-ha! Give him a big hand for that one, everybody!
        
        HAROLD: Get him.
        
        GEORGE: Whoops.
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Look what I've got. A tiny school filled with tiny children... and their tiny teachers whose tiny salaries... reflect their size and also... the value society puts on education.
        
        UNDERPANTS: I'll take that!
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Oh! Then I'll take that! Ow! Did you just slap me?
        
        HAROLD: Yes, I did. And you deserved it.
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: No, I didn't! Your hand is huge! That hurt a lot! Give it back, it's mine!
        
        HAROLD: No! Hands off!
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: No fair! No backsies!
        
        HAROLD: Give it to me!
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: Would you just give me that? (Squeaky Voice) Now look what you've done!
        
        HAROLD: Give it!
        
        GEORGE: Gotcha!
        
        UNDERPANTS: Yeah, that's more like it! Nice work, sidekicks! I'll just put this back down right here.
        
        HAROLD: No, no, no! Captain Underpants...
        
        UNDERPANTS: There we go. Back to normal... like it never happened.
        
        GEORGE: Oh, no, where'd he go?
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: You'll never catch me! You can't stop Professor Poopypants!
        
        Get back here!
        
        GEORGE: I can't reach!
        
        HAROLD: Get him, Captain Underpants!
        
        UNDERPANTS: A bee! Get away from me!
        
        [He swats Poopypants away, sending him flying.]
        
        PROF. POOPYPANTS: I'm free!
        
        GEORGE: What? What the... Why would you do that?! You just let the bad guy get away!
        
        UNDERPANTS: Come on, guys. Pretty sure the bee wasn't the bad guy.
        
        OFFICER: What the heck happened here?
        
        UNDERPANTS: You're welcome, peace keeper!
        
        HAROLD: Would you keep it down?
        
        UNDERPANTS: Did not see that coming! Take that, Doctor Diaper!
        
        GEORGE: I can't believe we made him.
        
        HAROLD: And he's even dumber in real life.
        
        UNDERPANTS: Oh! Look! Little dolphins!
        
        HAROLD: We have to get rid of him, don't we?
        
        GEORGE: I think we do. I mean, he's a way bigger problem than Mr. Krupp ever was.
        
        [They look at the Mr. Krupp drawing on the dartboard.]
        
        HAROLD: But, you know, George... bringing back Krupp permanently... we'll never be in the same class again.
        
        GEORGE: Yeah, I know. But just 'cause we're in separate classes, doesn't mean we can't be friends...
        
        HAROLD: Well, yeah. I mean, we'll always be friends. Right?
        
        GEORGE: Yeah. Hey, in fact, you know what? Let's do a blood oath. But minus the blood. I don't wanna see the blood. No blood.
        
        HAROLD: Pinky swear?
        
        GEORGE: No, that's lame. Mmm-mmm.
        
        HAROLD: Oh, got it! [spits]
        
        GEORGE: Oh, no. What? No! That's not sanitary. Can't we just do a verbal declaration of friendship or something?
        
        HAROLD: Oh. Okay. Yeah, wow. I haven't really prepared anything, but... I, Harold... hereby declare George as my best friend, permanently, forever.
        
        GEORGE: And I, George, accept the permanent rights... that Harold has given me to be his best friend forever... and the constitution of friends...
        
        America, friendship.
        
        And the United States of America.
        
        Land and the United States.
        
        Good, okay, yeah.
        
        It's done. All right, cool.
        
        HAROLD: Phew. What a relief.
        
        GEORGE: Yeah, no kidding. I mean, why were we even worried... about that whole classroom thing in the first place?
        
        HAROLD: You know, I don't know. We were younger then. Clearly, we have grown.
        
        GEORGE: Clearly, we have.
        
        UNDERPANTS Chums! Thank you for chronicling my surprisingly grounded biography. The truth is a slippery thing. And you nailed it. (Laughs and rubs their heads as he gets up) Now it is time to fly again! Farewell, my dear sidekicks.
        
        GEORGE: (pulls out the hypno ring) Goodbye, Captain Underpants.
        
        HAROLD: Goodbye.
        
        [George drops the ring on the ground and stomps it, causing the effects of the ring to be removed.]
        
        MR. KRUPP: George! Harold! What am I doing in your tree house again? You boys are in big trouble! I don't know how big yet... Why does this keep happening? Where are my clothes? Where are they?
        
        GEORGE: I don't get it. Why is Krupp so angry and Captain Underpants so happy?
        
        HAROLD: Maybe it's because Captain Underpants had us. You know, he had friends.
        
        GEORGE: We could fix that.
        
        HAROLD: Yeah, you know, we could.
        
        GEORGE: So that's how we came to pull the rarest prank of all... The prank... for good.
        
        KRUPP: Huh? "Do you want to go a date?" A date? "Love, Edith."
        
        EDITH: "Principal Krupp." Oh! Benjamin Krupp, you sly dog.
        
        KRUPP: Edith, the lunch lady.
        
        GEORGE: Big plans tonight, Mr. Krupp?
        
        KRUPP: No! What? That's none of your business! But, if you must know... yeah, I actually do. By the way, I was tidying up my office... and I believe these belong to you...
        
        HAROLD: Our comics?
        
        GEORGE: Did you just pull that out of the garbage can?
        
        KRUPP: Well, I read them... and considering they're completely implausible, juvenile... and filled with the lowest form of wit... potty humor... they're actually pretty funny. See ya later!
        
        HAROLD: Well, how about that...
        
        EDITH: That's a good one.
        
        GEORGE: You know, it feels good to do something nice for Mr. Krupp.
        
        HAROLD: Yeah, you know what? It does.
        
        GEORGE: Promise we'll never do it again.
        
        HAROLD: Promise.
        
        EDITH: Oh, my! I've never been to such a fancy restaurant before.
        
        KRUPP: Well, I had to go all out for m'lady.
        
        EDITH: Okay, if you say so, my man!
        
        GEORGE: Once again, that brings our story to its happy conclusion.
        
        HAROLD: I think there's some valuable life lessons in there... somewhere. What the?
        
        GEORGE: You gotta be kidding me! No!
        
        EDITH: Oh no!
        
        KRUPP: Waiter! Check please!
        
        [He snaps his fingers which causes him to take off his clothes and grab the tablecloth as a cape.]
        
        EDITH: Principal Krupp!
        
        GEORGE AND HAROLD: Oh no!
        
        GEORGE: Help!
        
        UNDERPANTS: Hang on, sidekicks!
        
        GEORGE: I don't get it! I really thought breaking that ring would get rid of his powers!
        
        [Captain Underpants charged through the toilets.]
        
        HAROLD: Yeah, well, here we go again!
        
        [He flies high to the sky while saying his epic catchphrase.]
        
        UNDERPANTS: Tra-la-laa!
        
        [The movie cuts to the main title of the film. Roll credits. In the final scene, George and Harold notice Ms. Anthrope is still on the phone while sleeping.]
        
        GEORGE: Wait.
        
        HAROLD: No way!
        
        GEORGE: She's been on hold for, like, the whole movie. Come on, come on.
        
        [He gets back on the phone.]
        
        GEORGE: (on phone) Hello. (Anthrope wakes up) Thank you for holding. How can I help...
        
        [The phone hangs up and Ms. Anthrope snaps.]
        
        MS. ANTHROPE: Nooooo!!!
        
        [The scene transitions to a comic book cover. The title is "Captain Underpants and the Attack of Stuck On-Hold Woman."]</h1>
